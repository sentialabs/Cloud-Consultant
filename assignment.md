## General Information
This assignment is meant to challenge the potential applicant in the complete spectrum of designing a solution and delivering a proposal for the public cloud.
Please be aware of the fact that we are not only looking at the actual deliverables but also the process followed to achieve these results. *The presentation of the results is of equal importance as the actual outcome.*

## Assignment
A client has an interface published, based on a node.js application. This application runs on a host with NGINX. Another process is also running for batch processing for asynchronous message replication. The application is making use of a MongoDB database.

This system connects with a back-end within the customers secured private network. The data handled in this case by the specific applications is however permitted to be handled and transferred in and over public networks, as long the data is encrypted during every stage of the process. The back-end needs to remain secure.

The client has a strong public cloud policy, where everything is preferably placed in a public cloud. A large contract is in place with Microsoft, however, depending on the specific case AWS is also allowed as a public cloud vendor.

The application is maintained by a team with a strong background of software engineering on top of Heroku. This team will remain to be responsible for the software engineering & -maintenance of this front-end.

The client desire a new environment for this application. They have had problems in the past regarding performance. The application couldn't handle the load during peak moments. There were also incidents where incoming messages have disappeared before they were actually processed. Availability, in general, was also an issue.

## Deliverables
A proposal including technical design for the setup of this environment with...

...reference architecture for connecting new world applications (multi experienced apps) with old world (legacy monolithic systems) apps,<br />
...and including appropriate required environments with a comparison between Azure, AWS or GCP (pick at least two variations) expressed in effort and costs,<br />
...and a concluding advise.<br />

Please present during the presentation meeting the following:
How would you design the setup for this application based on the information given in the case?
What would be your approach in transforming this environment together with the customer and her DEV team?
During this meeting you have to convince the audience of your proposal.
